// Based on InvenSense MPU-6050 register map document rev. 2.0, 5/19/2011 (RM-MPU-6000A-00)
// 5/20/2013 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
// Updates should (hopefully) always be available at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
//
// Changelog:
// 2019/07/08 - merged all DMP Firmware configuration items into the dmpMemory array
//            - Simplified dmpInitialize() to accomidate the dmpmemory array alterations
//     ... - ongoing debug release
